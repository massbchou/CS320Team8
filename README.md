## Campuswire Analytics Dashboard

### Description

This is an analytics dashboard built for a popular class forum website called Campuswire with the aim of giving course staff the data analytics they need to efficiently monitor and manage their forum.

### Tech stack

The dashboard is a web application built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs), a [React](https://react.dev/) frontend framework. The team utilized [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) for the databases that store the forum post data as well as for the cache for our various features.

### Features

#### Overview Tab

The app includes a completed 'At-a-glance' Overview tab that shows all of the relevant information that a member of the course staff might want to see immediately as they enter:

- **Unanswered Questions**: a list of questions that don't either have a mod answer or an answer that has been endorsed. This can easily be modified to also display the number of unanswered questions.
- **Top Posts**: a list of posts sorted by their 'score', which is determined by the following metrics: unique views, repeated views, number of comments, number of likes, and the number of days it has been since the post was made
- **Trending Topics**: a ranked list of keywords generated by a Python NLP keyword extraction library ([YAKE!](https://pypi.org/project/yake/)) based on the title and body texts of recent posts
- **Most Active Users**: a list of users sorted by their engagement on the forum

All of these features are implemented on the frontend through a React `<Feature>` component that allows for a scalable, flexible, and standardized design.

#### Caching

The team has implemented caching functionality for our features such that when a list of values has to be generated for a specific post collection date, it first checks the caching database to see if that value is already in cache. If it is, it simply returns the cached values for display, and if it isn't, it generates and caches them for next time. This has given our app a noticable performance increase.
